# Geyser Extension Template
A Geyser Extension template for creating Geyser Extensions. 

## What are Geyser extensions?
Geyser Extensions are the equivalent of “plugins”, but specifically for the Geyser platform. This brings the advantage of them being platform-agnostic, meaning that you won’t have to worry about supporting all platforms individually. Additionally, they will be, by design, only applied for Bedrock players joining via Geyser.

## What can extensions do?
- Register [custom items](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/custom-items/), [custom blocks](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/custom-blocks/#geyser-extensions) and more in code!
- Listen and toggle various Bedrock features (i.e. commands)
- Send forms to Bedrock players using [Cumulus](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Cumulus)
- Listen and interact with [Events](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/events/)
